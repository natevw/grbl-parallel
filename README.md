# Grbl shield for CNC 3020/3040 parallel port

[work in progress]

This is an Eagle schematic and layout for connecting the Grbl's default pinout to the usual found on YooCNC-family "Chinese CNC" controller boxes. It is intended for isolation milling onto a single-layer PCB (using wires for the other layer).
